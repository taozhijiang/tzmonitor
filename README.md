### Heracles

***Heracles*** is a high performance and easily used runtime information collecting and storing system. Though it can not compare with other monitoring systems for maturity, stability, scaling and beauty, but I believe Heracles is suitable for some specific situations. The most emphasized point is the easily historical information selection, which is very important for feedback-support system, lots of business runtime information is not only can be used for display and alarm, but can help the system make decisions smartly and automatically.   

The key points of Heraclesâ€™s design and implementation includes:
1. Friendly and easily used interface, support both report and select functions. We supported client library and single header file is enough.   
2. Whole system is built on [tzrpc](https://github.com/taozhijiang/tzrpc), which is a high performance RPC framework based on boost.asio and protobuf, our single client can report up to 50k events per second.   
3. Both client and server can dynamically scale-up and scale-down threadpool size based on overloads, and some parameters support dynamically updating.   
4. Mysql and LevelDB consistent storage methods are currently supported, and others can be easily added by implementing specified methods.   
5. A simple [tzhttpd](https://github.com/taozhijiang/tzhttpd) drivend http_face web interface, though currently looks not beautiful enough.   

Like usual, RHEL-6.x and RHEL-7.x are officially supported. You may also be interested in my other project [Argus](https://taozhijiang/argus) for better use of Heracles.
